# SVBot
Node.js Subversion (SVN) automatic uping.  

## What
a script for automaticly up svn repo, all 30 minutes, all days for this first version [see roadmap]

## Why
if you need to "fetch" a svn repo all 30 minutes (considered as an "user action" for most organizations like schools for eg ...) then it's made for you ... üòú

## Roadmap
üîß upping a repo all 30 minutes.  
‚è≥ upping only when it's time to (for eg only 3 days in the week).  
‚è≥ adding a logger.  
‚è≥ move some things to a config file.  
‚è≥ gmail send logs (hourly probably, for being sure).  
‚è≥ add to the config active repos workspace / name.  
‚è≥ rotate the repos (randomly probably).  
‚è≥ replace actives workspaces list by a recursive search of .svn directories in a specific directory.  

‚è≥ api && maybe other cool things.
