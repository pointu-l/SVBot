# SVBot
Node.js Subversion (SVN) automatic uping.  

## What
a script for automaticly up svn repo, all 30 minutes, all days for this first version [see roadmap]

## Why
if you need to "fetch" a svn repo all 30 minutes (considered as an "user action" for most organizations like schools for eg ...) then it's made for you ... 😜

## Roadmap
upping a repo all 30 minutes
upping only when it's time to (for eg only 3 days in the week)
adding a logger
move some things to a config file
gmail send logs (hourly probably, for being sure)
add to the config active repos workspace / name
rotate the repos (randomly probably)
replace actives workspaces list by a recursive search of .svn directories in a specific directory

api && maybe other cool things
